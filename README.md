# TF-Unity-ARFoundation

Detect apple (the fruit) from camera frame then place an AR apple on it. Uses TensorFlow for object detection and ARFoundation for AR experience. Tested with iOS and ARKit only but should work with Android and ARCore as well.

The scene is modified from CameraImage in [arfoundation-samples](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/arfoundation-samples). 

## Usage

1. Open the project in Unity3d, go to Window > Package Manager, install AR Foundation and at least one platform-specific AR package:
* ARKit XR Plugin
* ARCore XR Plugin

2. Follow the installation instructions in [TF-Unity](https://github.com/shaqian/TF-Unity).

3. Build and run.
